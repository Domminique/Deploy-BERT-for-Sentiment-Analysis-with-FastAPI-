# Deploy BERT for Sentiment Analsysi with FastAPI

Deploy a pre-trained BERT model for Sentiment Analysis as a REST API using FastAPI

## Demo

The model is trained to classify sentiment (negative, neutral, and positive) on a custom dataset from app reviews on Google Play. Here's a sample request to the API:

```bash
http POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict text="Good basic lists, i would like to create more lists, but the annual fee for unlimited lists is too out there"
```

The response you'll get looks something like this:

```js
{
    "confidence": 0.9999083280563354,
    "probabilities": {
        "negative": 3.563107020454481e-05,
        "neutral": 0.9999083280563354,
        "positive": 5.596495248028077e-05
    },
    "sentiment": "neutral"
}
```
